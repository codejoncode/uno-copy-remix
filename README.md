The idea of this game comes from the way I grew up playing the game so I want to work on this game and build it so I can play it how I want to  online. It has been said that some of the things I am going to implement goes against the classic game's rules. This maybe true which is why I am creating it. If you go against the normal rules  then you can't find a place to play online.

There is a serious amount of logic to coding up the regular game. With the ability to play multiple cards each time around for each user the logic gets even more complex. This is actually the main reason I wanted to code this. Outside of playing with friends I think this is a nice challege.
